This is a Jekyll project template, to be forked for specific courses or
projects.

Features:
- LaTeX mathematical equations rendered by MathJax
- p5 sketch embedding helper functions:
    - mouse -> arrow key event delegation
    - windowResized() event handling

This project relies solely on open source software and tools, including:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/): static site generator, for this website
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): JavaScript graphics library for creative coding
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/): JavaScript library for rendering LaTeX math
- [Comic Mono](https://dtinth.github.io/comic-mono-font/): font for the code examples
